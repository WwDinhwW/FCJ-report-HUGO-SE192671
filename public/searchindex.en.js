    "content": "Build a Basic AWS VPC with Public \u0026 Private Subnets In this workshop, you will build a simple network foundation in AWS using Amazon VPC (Virtual Private Cloud). The goal is to help beginners understand how networking works in the cloud, and how different components connect together to form a secure, controlled environment.\nYou will create a VPC with two subnets:\nA Public Subnet – allows resources (like EC2 instances) to access the Internet directly. A Private Subnet – isolated from the public Internet by default for better security. To enable the private subnet to download packages and access online services without being exposed publicly, you will configure:\nAn Internet Gateway (IGW) – allows public subnet traffic to flow to/from the Internet. A NAT Gateway – lets instances in the private subnet access the Internet indirectly, without assigning a public IP. By the end, you will spin up two EC2 instances — one in each subnet — and test communication between them while observing the role of routing and gateways.\nThis hands-on workshop teaches essential AWS networking fundamentals through guided steps and console navigation. Perfect for beginners who want to build confidence working with VPCs.",

For security reasons, we had to blurred some details.\n8.2 SSH from Public EC2 to Private EC2 Before you can do this step, you must copy your EC2 instance key/pair into the public EC2 instance EC2-Public This is not a recommended action by AWS. As it is a great security risk to put access keys onto EC2 instances. However, for the sake of simplicity in our purpose of testing connections. You can do this.\nFrom the terminal on your machine (logged out of any EC2 intances). Run this: scp -i \"Workshop-Key.pem\" Workshop-Key.pem ec2-user\u003cPUBLIC_IP_HERE\u003e:/home/ec2-user/\rThis copies your access key into the public EC2 instance EC2-Public to be used later in accessing the private EC2 instance EC2-Private\nThen SSH into EC2-Public like you did before in section 8.1 and run: chmod 400 Workshop-Key.pem\rThis limit the permissions of the copied access key, securing it. Allowing you to use it later to SSH into the private EC2 instance EC2-Private\nThen run this: ssh -i \"Workshop-Key.pem\" ec2-user@\u003cPRIVATE_IP_HERE\u003e\rSuccess, you have successfully SSH into the private EC2 instance EC2-Private from the only allowed source of connection: The public EC2 instance EC2-Public\n8.3 Test Internet Connectivity from Private Instance Run this: ping -c 3 google.com sudo yum update -y\rExpected behavior: Action Result ping google.com Replies received yum update Packages download successfully → If this works, NAT Gateway routing is confirmed.\nSuccessful internet connection from the private EC2 instance EC2-Private\n8.4 Validate Security Behavior (Important Check) Test Expected Result Your PC → Private instance SSH Blocked Public EC2 → Private EC2 SSH Allowed Private EC2 → Internet Works via NAT → This confirms public exposure = controlled, and private access = secure + functional.\nAs expected.

DEVELOPER WORKFLOW (DevSecOps with Zero-Downtime Deployment) Developer → Git push → GitHub → CodePipeline triggered → CodeBuild runs: • Install dependencies • Run tests (pytest) • Security scan (Bandit, Safety) • Build frontend • SSH to EC2 (via Elastic IP) → Deploy new version • ALB health check validates deployment • Traffic cutover (zero downtime) → CloudWatch logs everything\r2. INCOMING TRAFFIC (Production Flow) Client Browser → HTTPS (Cloudflare CDN/SSL) → Internet Gateway → ALB (ACM certificate, SSL termination) → Target Group (health check: /health endpoint) → EC2 Instance (Elastic IP attached, FastAPI application) → Response back through ALB → Client\r3. CLIENT SIGNUP Customer → Enter AWS Access key → Click login → Account auto create → API (through ALB) → Validate AWS keys → Store in Secrets Manager (KMS encrypted) → Store metadata in DynamoDB\r4. EMAIL VERIFICATION Customer → Enter email → Check email → Send verify email → Click link → ALB → API → Verify token → Mark email verified → CloudTrail logs event\r5. WORKER MANAGER (Multi-Tenant) Every 15 min → Fetch active clients from DynamoDB → For each client: • Get credentials from Secrets Manager • Schedule async task for data collection • Collect AWS data • Cache in Redis (5 min TTL) • Store in DynamoDB\r6. DATA COLLECTION (Per Client) Async Task → Secrets Manager (get credentials) → Client AWS API → Collect metrics → Cache in Redis → Store in DynamoDB (partitioned by aws_account_id) → If critical finding → Send email alert (SES) → CloudWatch logs all operations\r7. DASHBOARD DISPLAY Customer login → Request through ALB → FastAPI checks Redis cache → Cache HIT: Return cached data (\u003c 200ms) → Cache MISS: Query DynamoDB (filtered by aws_account_id) → Store in Redis → Return data through ALB\r8. HEALTH CHECKS \u0026 FAILOVER ALB → Every 30s → GET /health endpoint → If unhealthy (2 consecutive failures): • Mark target unhealthy • Stop routing traffic • CloudWatch alarm triggered • Systemd attempts auto-restart → When healthy: Resume traffic routing\r9. SSH ACCESS \u0026 MANAGEMENT DevOps Engineer → SSH to Elastic IP → Direct EC2 access for: • Deployment verification • Log inspection • Emergency troubleshooting • System maintenance → Stable IP (no DNS updates needed)\r10. SECURITY \u0026 AUDIT All API calls → CloudTrail logging Credentials access → CloudWatch alarm Failed auth attempts → Email alert KMS key usage → Audit trail ALB access logs → S3 (optional, for compliance)\r4.

    "content": "This section will list and introduce the blogs that I have translated.\nBlog 1 - Implementing DevSecOps Ecosystem for Amazon Connect at NatWest. NatWest implemented Amazon Connect with a full DevSecOps ecosystem to power a large-scale, multi-team contact center. Instead of multiple instances, they ran a single shared Connect instance but separated environments across AWS accounts for dev, test, pre-prod, prod, and DR — improving control, security, and stability. Infrastructure was managed through modular Terraform, letting teams deploy independently while enforcing consistent naming, tagging, and security standards. For faster delivery, they built export-import CI/CD pipelines for Amazon Lex bots and QuickSight dashboards instead of writing everything as IaC. Security was multi-layered, combining preventive guardrails (modules, SCPs, static scanning) and detective controls (Config, Inspector, CloudWatch, Security Hub). They also developed utilities to export contact flows as Terraform, manage Contact Lens rules, and generate performance insights. The result: faster development, more reliable releases, stronger security, and a standardized way to operate Amazon Connect across the organization.\nRead full blogs on Google Docs\nBlog 2 - Leverage Q Developer and AWS Chatbot in Slack. This article explains how Amazon Q Developer and AWS Chatbot can be integrated into Slack to provide AI-assisted AWS help directly within a team’s communication workspace. Q Developer acts as a conversational assistant that answers questions, suggests best practices, and helps with onboarding, troubleshooting, architecture design, and certification learning paths. Meanwhile, AWS Chatbot enables users to run AWS CLI commands, open support cases, and receive alerts or notifications from services like S3, Lambda, CloudWatch, and EventBridge — all without leaving Slack. Combined, they support both technical and non-technical users, boosting collaboration and productivity across an organization.\nThe blog highlights real use cases including training new engineers, diagnosing performance issues, optimizing workloads, and applying AWS Well-Architected best practices. It also shows how Q Developer and Chatbot can work together — for example, Chatbot sends alerts to Slack, and Q Developer can interpret those alerts and suggest next steps. An architecture flow is provided showing how Slack connects to Chatbot, which routes requests to Q Developer when needed, with logs stored in CloudWatch. The article ends with setup guidance, covering Chatbot configuration, Slack integration, and enabling Q Developer support — emphasizing that following documentation order is important for a smooth deployment.\nRead full blogs on Google Docs\nBlog 3 - Ten Features to Help Efficiently Manage AWS Applications from Microsoft Teams and Slack Using AWS Chatbot. This article highlights ten AWS Chatbot features that improve DevOps workflows by enabling teams to operate AWS applications directly inside Microsoft Teams and Slack. With ChatOps, engineers can monitor cloud systems, troubleshoot incidents, pull CloudWatch metrics, run commands, retrieve logs, and collaborate in real time without switching tools. Chatbot supports Amazon Q Developer for conversational AWS guidance, as well as IaC provisioning via CDK, SDKs, Cloud Control API, and Terraform. It also allows customizable notifications through SNS/EventBridge, built-in access to CloudWatch dashboards and Logs Insights, and command aliases for fast operational tasks. Action buttons can be added to alerts to trigger automated runbooks, and users can even query resource inventory using natural language. Tags are supported for policy control and organization. These capabilities collectively bring observability and operational response into chat channels, speeding up resolution time and improving team collaboration. All ten features are free to use.\nRead full blogs on Google Docs",

    "content": "Personal Feedback – AWS First Cloud Journey (FCJ) During my time in AWS Vietnam under the First Cloud Journey (FCJ) program, I experienced a learning environment that challenged me, accelerated my growth, and pushed me beyond the typical student-level knowledge.\nFCJ rewards those who are self-driven. I believe it is an exceptional program, but not universally easy. It benefits students who come with curiosity, resilience, and the willingness to learn through action rather than instruction. People like me, who enjoy exploring deeply and independently, will grow extremely fast here.\nOverall Evaluation What FCJ Did Extremely Well Strength Why it matters Autonomy to learn \u0026 build independently I wasn’t handed answers, I learned by thinking, trying, and solving. Full real AWS access (not sandbox-level) Allowed true production-oriented experimentation, not just theory. Cloud Optimization \u0026 Cost Awareness Rarely taught in school, yet critical in real cloud engineering. Hands-off mentoring approach Guided by questions and direction, not micromanagement. Strong documentation \u0026 learning resources Helped me research deeply and build at my own pace. Growth in Backend + DevOps + Security Redis caching, IAM, KMS, CloudWatch, CI/CD, and more, all hands-on, not just lectures. High learning curve, in a good way The pace never felt boring. You learn as fast as you push yourself. The program shaped my mindset as much as my technical skills, I now think in terms of scalability, cost, security, monitoring, failure-tolerance, not just “make it run”.\nWhere FCJ Can Improve FCJ teaches the tools, but could add more production practice Technical knowledge was excellent, AWS services, backend development, optimization principles, but I believe the program could be even better with more exposure to real production workflows, such as:\nImprovement Suggestion Benefit to Future Interns More production-style simulations Helps interns learn how systems behave under real load. Practical troubleshooting challenges Builds confidence in debugging failures \u0026 analyzing incidents. More real-world scenario workshops Connects AWS theory with actual industry operations. Not a criticism, more like potential fuel to make an already strong program even stronger.\nWho I Recommend FCJ To I would absolutely recommend FCJ, but only to the right type of person.\nPerfect for:\nStudents who want to build, not just watch People who enjoy self-learning \u0026 documentation digging Those who like challenge over comfort Anyone who wants real AWS, not just classroom AWS Not ideal for:\nSomeone who waits for instructions Someone afraid to try, break, learn, retry Someone looking for 9-5 low effort routine FCJ is not easy. But it is worth it, massively.\nFinal Thoughts FCJ has been one of the most valuable learning experiences I’ve ever had.\nI walk away not only with technical skills, but with mindset, discipline, and confidence that I can build, scale, secure, and optimize cloud systems on my own.\nMy conclusion is simple:\nFCJ doesn’t just teach cloud, it shapes cloud engineers.",

    "content": "EVENT REPORT: Building Agentic AI \u0026 Context Optimization with Amazon Bedrock Date: Friday, December 5, 2025\nTime: 8:30 AM – 12:00 AM\nLocation: AWS Vietnam Office, Bitexco Financial Tower, District 1, Ho Chi Minh City\nExecutive Summary I attended a comprehensive half-day workshop on Agentic AI using Amazon Bedrock at the AWS Vietnam Office. The session covered the architecture and implementation of AI agents from foundational concepts through hands-on development. The workshop was particularly valuable for understanding how to build production-grade agentic systems that can autonomously orchestrate complex workflows, make decisions, and integrate with external tools. While my Cloud Health Dashboard currently uses traditional monitoring approaches, the concepts presented here open possibilities for AI-powered security analysis, automated remediation recommendations, and intelligent anomaly detection.\nOpening Session: Agentic AI Landscape (9:00 - 9:10 AM) Nguyen Gia Hung, Head of Solutions Architect, framed the workshop by distinguishing between traditional AI applications and agentic systems. The key difference: agency - the ability of AI systems to perceive environments, make decisions, take actions, and learn from outcomes without constant human intervention.\nAWS Bedrock Agent Core Architecture (9:10 - 9:40 AM) Kien Nguyen’s technical deep dive into Bedrock Agents revealed the underlying architecture that makes autonomous AI systems possible.\nWhat is Amazon Bedrock? Bedrock is AWS’s fully managed service for foundation models (FMs) from providers like Anthropic (Claude), Meta (Llama), Cohere, AI21, and Amazon’s own Titan models. Key differentiators:\nNo infrastructure management: No EC2 instances, no model hosting, no scaling concerns Model choice flexibility: Switch between models via API without code changes Security \u0026 compliance: Models run within AWS infrastructure, data doesn’t leave your VPC Fine-tuning \u0026 customization: Train models on proprietary data while maintaining data privacy Bedrock Agents - The Core Concept:\nAgents are autonomous systems that can:\nUnderstand user intent through natural language Break down complex requests into executable steps (reasoning) Select and invoke appropriate tools (APIs, Lambda functions, knowledge bases) Orchestrate multi-step workflows dynamically Return structured responses with citations and reasoning traces The architecture diagram showed:\nUser Request ↓ Bedrock Agent (Orchestrator) ↓ ┌─────────────┬──────────────┬─────────────┐ │ Foundation │ Action │ Knowledge │ │ Model │ Groups │ Bases │ │ (Claude) │ (Tools) │ (RAG) │ └─────────────┴──────────────┴─────────────┘ ↓ Response with reasoning trace\rAction Groups - Extending Agent Capabilities:\nAction groups define what an agent can do. Each action group contains:\nOpenAPI schema: Defines available functions, parameters, return types Lambda function: Backend logic that executes the action Description: Helps the model understand when to use this action When a user asks “What should I do about this high-severity GuardDuty finding?”, the agent:\nRecognizes it needs security analysis capability Selects analyzeGuardDutyFinding function Invokes Lambda with finding details Receives structured response Formulates human-readable recommendation Knowledge Bases - RAG Integration:\nKnowledge bases allow agents to query proprietary documents using semantic search. The workflow:\nIngestion: Documents (PDFs, web pages, text files) stored in S3 Chunking: Documents split into smaller segments (1000 tokens default) Embedding: Each chunk converted to vector embeddings using Titan Embeddings Storage: Vectors stored in OpenSearch Serverless (or other vector DBs) Retrieval: Agent queries knowledge base, gets most relevant chunks Generation: Model generates response using retrieved context For my dashboard, I could create knowledge bases containing:\nAWS security best practices documentation CIS Benchmark requirements Internal security runbooks Past incident reports When users ask “How should I configure VPC Flow Logs?”, the agent would retrieve relevant documentation chunks and provide contextualized answers specific to their environment.\nGuardrails - Responsible AI:\nBedrock Guardrails ensure agents behave safely:\nContent filters: Block harmful, biased, or inappropriate outputs Denied topics: Prevent discussion of specified subjects Word filters: Block profanity or sensitive terms PII redaction: Automatically mask sensitive information Hallucination detection: Reduce factually incorrect responses For production deployment, guardrails are essential to prevent agents from suggesting dangerous remediation actions ( like deleting production databases).\nPrompt Engineering for Agents:\nThe session revealed that agent prompts differ from standard LLM prompts. Agent prompts must:\nDefine agent role and responsibilities clearly Specify how to use tools (when to call, what parameters to pass) Provide response formatting instructions Include examples of correct tool usage Set boundaries (what NOT to do) Example agent instruction for security analysis:\nYou are a cloud security analyst specializing in AWS environments. Your role is to: 1. Analyze security findings from GuardDuty, Security Hub, and IAM Access Analyzer 2. Prioritize findings by severity and business impact 3. Recommend specific, actionable remediation steps 4. Explain the risk context in business terms When analyzing findings: - Always check the severity level first - Use the analyzeGuardDutyFinding tool for detailed analysis - Cross-reference with AWS security best practices knowledge base - Provide both immediate containment steps and long-term preventive measures Do NOT: - Make changes to production resources without explicit user confirmation - Suggest deleting resources without understanding their purpose - Provide generic recommendations without environment-specific context\rUse Case: Building Agentic Workflow on AWS (9:40 - 10:00 AM) Viet Pham, Founder \u0026 CEO of an AI startup, shared a real-world implementation of agentic workflows in production. The use case involved building a customer support automation system for an e-commerce platform.\nThe Problem: Traditional chatbots follow decision trees - rigid, limited, and break when users ask unexpected questions. The company needed a system that could:\nUnderstand complex, multi-intent customer queries Access order databases, inventory systems, shipping APIs Make intelligent decisions (refund vs. exchange vs. escalate) Handle conversations across multiple turns Maintain context throughout the interaction The Solution - Agentic Workflow Architecture:\nCustomer Query → Bedrock Agent → Orchestration Logic ↓ ┌──────────────────────┼──────────────────────┐ ↓ ↓ ↓ Order Lookup Inventory Check Shipping API (Lambda + RDS) (Lambda + DynamoDB) (La ↓mbda + 3rd-party) ↓ ↓ └──────────────────────┴───────────────────────┘ ↓ Agent Decision Making ↓ Response + Action Taken\rAgent Workflow Example:\nUser: “I ordered a laptop 3 days ago but haven’t received shipping confirmation. Can I change the shipping address?”\nAgent reasoning trace (shown in the demo):\nIntent Recognition: Order status query + shipping address modification Tool Selection: Call getOrderStatus with order ID (extracted from customer session) Tool Execution: Lambda queries RDS, returns order details Analysis: Order in “processing” state, not yet shipped Decision: Address modification is possible Tool Selection: Call updateShippingAddress Confirmation: Ask user for new address before executing Tool Execution: Update address in database Response Generation: Confirm change + provide estimated shipping date The beauty of this approach: no hardcoded decision trees. The agent dynamically determines workflow based on real-time data and user intent.\nMulti-Step Reasoning Pattern:\nThe demo showed how agents handle complex queries requiring multiple API calls:\nUser: “What’s the cheapest laptop under $1000 that can be delivered by Friday?”\nAgent workflow:\nQuery 1: searchProducts(category=\"laptop\", max_price=1000) → Returns 15 products Query 2: checkInventory(productIds=[...]) → Returns in-stock items Query 3: getShippingEstimate(productIds=[...], targetDate=\"Friday\") → Returns delivery dates Synthesis: Agent compares prices and delivery dates, ranks options Response: “The HP Pavilion 15 at $899 can arrive Thursday. Would you like to proceed?” This multi-step reasoning is what makes agents “intelligent” - they don’t just execute predefined workflows, they construct workflows on the fly.\nError Handling \u0026 Fallbacks:\nA critical part of the presentation covered what happens when tools fail:\nAPI timeout: Agent retries with exponential backoff, or suggests alternative action Invalid parameters: Agent reformulates request with corrected parameters Ambiguous intent: Agent asks clarifying questions rather than guessing Out-of-scope request: Agent escalates to human agent gracefully The error handling wasn’t hardcoded - the agent’s foundation model reasoning enabled it to adapt to failures contextually.\nProduction Metrics Shared:\nQuery resolution rate: 78% fully automated (vs. 35% with traditional chatbot) Average response time: 4.2 seconds for multi-step queries Customer satisfaction: 4.1/5 (vs. 3.2/5 for previous system) Cost: ~$0.03 per conversation (Bedrock API + Lambda execution) Key Takeaway for My Project: The multi-step reasoning pattern applies directly to security incident investigation. When a GuardDuty finding appears, an agent could: (1) Fetch finding details, (2) Query CloudTrail for related API calls, (3) Check IAM policies for affected resources, (4) Retrieve similar past incidents from knowledge base, (5) Generate contextual remediation plan. This transforms my dashboard from reactive (show finding) to proactive (investigate and recommend).\nCloudThinker Introduction (10:00 - 10:10 AM) Thang Ton, Co-founder \u0026 COO of CloudThinker, introduced their platform - an agentic orchestration layer built on top of Amazon Bedrock. CloudThinker addresses pain points in building production agentic systems:\nProblems with Raw Bedrock Agents:\nLimited observability: Hard to debug why agent made specific decisions Context window management: Agents lose context in long conversations Multi-agent coordination: No native support for agent-to-agent communication Prompt versioning: No built-in system for A/B testing prompts Cost optimization: Difficult to minimize token usage without sacrificing quality CloudThinker’s Value Proposition:\n1. Agentic Orchestration Layer:\nMulti-agent workflows: Coordinate specialist agents (data analyst agent + report writer agent) Agent handoff: Seamlessly transfer context between agents Parallel execution: Run multiple agents simultaneously, synthesize results Conditional routing: Route to appropriate agent based on query type 2. Context Optimization:\nIntelligent caching: Reuse embeddings for repeated queries Dynamic context pruning: Keep only relevant conversation history Hierarchical memory: Short-term (current session) + long-term (across sessions) Semantic compression: Summarize old context to save tokens 3. Observability \u0026 Debugging:\nAgent reasoning traces: See every decision, tool call, and model invocation Cost tracking: Per-conversation, per-agent, per-tool usage metrics Latency breakdown: Identify bottlenecks (embedding, retrieval, generation) A/B testing framework: Compare prompt variations systematically The platform demo showed a dashboard (meta: a dashboard for building my dashboard’s AI agent) with:\nReal-time agent execution visualization Token usage graphs Tool invocation frequency Success/failure rates per agent Pricing Model: CloudThinker charges based on orchestration complexity, not token usage:\nFree tier: 1,000 agent executions/month Pro: $99/month for 50,000 executions Enterprise: Custom pricing with dedicated support Since Bedrock costs are separate, this could be cost-effective for high-volume agent workloads where orchestration optimization reduces overall Bedrock token usage.\nKey Takeaway for My Project: If I build an AI agent for my dashboard, CloudThinker could help with observability and multi-agent coordination (e.g., one agent for GuardDuty analysis, another for IAM policy review, coordinated by orchestrator). However, for a student project, starting with raw Bedrock Agents makes more sense to understand fundamentals before adding abstraction layers.\nCloudThinker Agentic Orchestration Deep Dive (10:10 - 10:40 AM) Henry Bui, Head of Engineering, provided a technical deep dive into CloudThinker’s orchestration engine. This session was highly advanced (L300 level) and revealed sophisticated patterns for production agentic systems.\nContext Window Management - The Core Challenge:\nFoundation models have finite context windows:\nClaude 3.5 Sonnet: 200K tokens (~150K words) GPT-4 Turbo: 128K tokens Llama 3.1: 128K tokens In long conversations or complex workflows, context can exceed these limits. Traditional approaches:\nTruncation: Drop old messages (loses context) Summarization: Compress old context (loses details) Sliding window: Keep recent N messages (loses distant but relevant context) CloudThinker’s Hierarchical Memory System:\n┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐ │ Working Memory (Current Session) │ │ - Last 10 conversation turns │ │ - Active tool results │ │ - Temporary variables │ │ Token Budget: 20K tokens │ └─────────────────────────────────────────┘ ↕ (relevance-based retrieval) ┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐ │ Episodic Memory (Past Sessions) │ │ - Summarized conversation history │ │ - Key decisions \u0026 outcomes │ │ - User preferences learned │ │ Stored in: DynamoDB + Vector DB │ └─────────────────────────────────────────┘ ↕ (semantic similarity search) ┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐ │ Semantic Memory (Long-term Knowledge) │ │ - Domain facts │ │ - Procedures \u0026 best practices │ │ - Tool usage patterns │ │ Stored in: Knowledge Base (OpenSearch)│ └─────────────────────────────────────────┘\rHow It Works:\nNew user query arrives → Goes into Working Memory Relevance scoring: Semantic search across Episodic Memory for related past context Dynamic loading: Only relevant past context loaded into Working Memory Token budget enforcement: If over limit, least relevant context pruned After response: Conversation turn compressed and stored in Episodic Memory Example for my security dashboard:\nUser today: “Show me recent GuardDuty findings” → Agent retrieves findings, stores in Working Memory\nUser later: “Are any of these related to the credential exposure incident from last month?” → Agent searches Episodic Memory for “credential exposure” context → Loads relevant findings from that incident → Compares with current findings → Responds with correlation analysis\nThis enables long-term memory without blowing up context windows.\nMulti-Agent Orchestration Patterns:\nCloudThinker supports three agent collaboration patterns:\n1. Sequential (Pipeline):\nUser Query → Agent A (classifier) → Agent B (executor) → Agent C (formatter) → Response\rExample: Query classification → Data retrieval → Report generation\n2. Parallel (Fan-out/Fan-in):\n┌→ Agent A (GuardDuty analysis) User Query → Router ┼→ Agent B (IAM review) ┼→ Aggregator → Response └→ Agent C (VPC Flow analysis)\rExample: Comprehensive security assessment across multiple services\n3. Conditional (Decision Tree):\nUser Query → Router → IF security_finding: Agent A (incident response) ELIF billing_alert: Agent B (cost optimization) ELSE: Agent C (general assistance)\rThe demo showed a fraud detection use case with parallel agents:\nSuspicious Transaction Detected ↓ Orchestrator ↓ ┌─────┴──────┬────────┐ ↓ ↓ ↓ Account Behavior External History Pattern Threat Agent Agent Intelligence ↓ ↓ ↓ \"Normal \"Anomalous \"IP from user login known pattern\" location\" fraud list\" └─────┬──────┴────────┘ ↓ Aggregator Agent (Risk Scoring) ↓ Block transaction + Alert security team\rEach agent runs in parallel, results aggregated, decision made in ~3 seconds.\nFor my Cloud Health Dashboard, this pattern enables:\nUser: “Analyze the security posture of account X”\nOrchestrator ↓ ┌───┴───┬─────────┬────────┐ ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓ GuardDuty IAM VPC Data Analysis Review Config Encryption Agent Agent Agent Agent └───┬───┴─────────┴────────┘ ↓ Report Generation Agent ↓ Comprehensive Security Assessment\rPrompt Chaining \u0026 Self-Refinement:\nAdvanced pattern where agent critiques and improves its own output:\nStep 1: Generate initial response Step 2: Critique response (separate agent or same agent with critic role) Step 3: Refine based on critique Step 4: Validate against criteria Step 5: Return final response\rDemo showed code generation example:\nAgent generates Python function Critic agent reviews for security issues, edge cases, efficiency Original agent refines code based on feedback Validator checks if code passes test cases Iterations continue until validation passes (max 3 iterations) This self-refinement dramatically improves output quality, especially for complex tasks like IAM policy generation or CloudFormation template creation.\nCost Optimization Techniques:\nHenry shared production metrics showing CloudThinker’s optimizations:\nWithout optimization:\nAverage conversation: 45K tokens Cost per conversation: $0.15 (Claude Sonnet) 10,000 conversations/month: $1,500 With CloudThinker optimization:\nAverage conversation: 18K tokens (60% reduction) Cost per conversation: $0.06 10,000 conversations/month: $600 Optimization techniques used:\nSemantic caching: Cache embeddings for repeated queries (50% cache hit rate) Lazy loading: Only load knowledge base chunks when needed Compression: Summarize old context aggressively Model routing: Use cheaper models (Haiku) for simple queries, Sonnet for complex Batch processing: Group similar queries to reuse context Key Takeaway for My Project: The hierarchical memory system and multi-agent orchestration patterns are production-critical for any agentic system at scale. For my dashboard, starting with a single agent is appropriate, but architecting for future multi-agent expansion (separate agents for GuardDuty, IAM, Network, Data protection) ensures scalability. The cost optimization techniques are essential if I add AI features - even with AWS credits, efficient token usage matters.\nHands-On Workshop: Building a Bedrock Agent (11:00 - 12:00 PM) Kha Van led the practical workshop where we went to cloudthinker.io to optimaze cost, security and provide recommendations.\nConclusion \u0026 Reflection The AWS Bedrock Agentic AI workshop transformed my understanding of how AI can move from passive tools (chatbots) to active systems (agents). The five key layers of agentic systems—foundation models, tool integration, knowledge bases, orchestration, and guardrails—create capabilities that go far beyond traditional AI applications.\nMost Valuable Insights:\nAgents enable new UX patterns: Instead of users figuring out which dashboard section to click or which API to call, they ask natural language questions and the agent orchestrates the solution. This dramatically lowers the barrier to cloud security expertise.\nTool calling is the breakthrough: The ability for LLMs to reliably call external functions (APIs, databases, AWS services) with correct parameters turns language models from text generators into task executors.\nKnowledge bases solve the freshness problem: Instead of retraining models or hardcoding rules, knowledge bases let agents access up-to-date information (AWS documentation, security best practices) through semantic search.\nMulti-agent orchestration enables specialization: Rather than one monolithic agent trying to handle everything, specialized agents (GuardDuty expert, IAM expert, VPC expert) can collaborate, each leveraging focused knowledge.\nProduction requires observability: The reasoning trace feature is essential for debugging, compliance, and continuous improvement. Without visibility into agent decision-making, production deployment is reckless.\nPersonal Learning Outcomes:\nTechnical Depth: Gained hands-on experience with Bedrock Agents, action groups, knowledge bases, and OpenAPI schema design. The workshop code examples provide a clear template for my implementation.\nArchitectural Thinking: Understanding the tradeoffs between single-agent vs. multi-agent, synchronous vs. asynchronous, and real-time vs. batch processing will inform my dashboard design decisions.\nProduction Mindset: The emphasis on observability, cost optimization, and guardrails reinforced that production AI systems require infrastructure beyond the model itself—logging, monitoring, safety controls.\nAWS Service Integration: Learned how Bedrock integrates with broader AWS ecosystem (Lambda, S3, OpenSearch, CloudWatch, IAM). This reinforces my understanding of AWS service orchestration.",
    "description": "EVENT REPORT: Building Agentic AI \u0026 Context Optimization with Amazon Bedrock Date: Friday, December 5, 2025\nTime: 8:30 AM – 12:00 AM\nLocation: AWS Vietnam Office, Bitexco Financial Tower, District 1, Ho Chi Minh City\nExecutive Summary I attended a comprehensive half-day workshop on Agentic AI using Amazon Bedrock at the AWS Vietnam Office. The session covered the architecture and implementation of AI agents from foundational concepts through hands-on development. The workshop was particularly valuable for understanding how to build production-grade agentic systems that can autonomously orchestrate complex workflows, make decisions, and integrate with external tools. While my Cloud Health Dashboard currently uses traditional monitoring approaches, the concepts presented here open possibilities for AI-powered security analysis, automated remediation recommendations, and intelligent anomaly detection.",
