    "content": "Build a Basic AWS VPC with Public \u0026 Private Subnets In this workshop, you will build a simple network foundation in AWS using Amazon VPC (Virtual Private Cloud). The goal is to help beginners understand how networking works in the cloud, and how different components connect together to form a secure, controlled environment.\nYou will create a VPC with two subnets:\nA Public Subnet – allows resources (like EC2 instances) to access the Internet directly. A Private Subnet – isolated from the public Internet by default for better security. To enable the private subnet to download packages and access online services without being exposed publicly, you will configure:\nAn Internet Gateway (IGW) – allows public subnet traffic to flow to/from the Internet. A NAT Gateway – lets instances in the private subnet access the Internet indirectly, without assigning a public IP. By the end, you will spin up two EC2 instances — one in each subnet — and test communication between them while observing the role of routing and gateways.\nThis hands-on workshop teaches essential AWS networking fundamentals through guided steps and console navigation. Perfect for beginners who want to build confidence working with VPCs.",

For security reasons, we had to blurred some details.\n8.2 SSH from Public EC2 to Private EC2 Before you can do this step, you must copy your EC2 instance key/pair into the public EC2 instance EC2-Public This is not a recommended action by AWS. As it is a great security risk to put access keys onto EC2 instances. However, for the sake of simplicity in our purpose of testing connections. You can do this.\nFrom the terminal on your machine (logged out of any EC2 intances). Run this: scp -i \"Workshop-Key.pem\" Workshop-Key.pem ec2-user\u003cPUBLIC_IP_HERE\u003e:/home/ec2-user/\rThis copies your access key into the public EC2 instance EC2-Public to be used later in accessing the private EC2 instance EC2-Private\nThen SSH into EC2-Public like you did before in section 8.1 and run: chmod 400 Workshop-Key.pem\rThis limit the permissions of the copied access key, securing it. Allowing you to use it later to SSH into the private EC2 instance EC2-Private\nThen run this: ssh -i \"Workshop-Key.pem\" ec2-user@\u003cPRIVATE_IP_HERE\u003e\rSuccess, you have successfully SSH into the private EC2 instance EC2-Private from the only allowed source of connection: The public EC2 instance EC2-Public\n8.3 Test Internet Connectivity from Private Instance Run this: ping -c 3 google.com sudo yum update -y\rExpected behavior: Action Result ping google.com Replies received yum update Packages download successfully → If this works, NAT Gateway routing is confirmed.\nSuccessful internet connection from the private EC2 instance EC2-Private\n8.4 Validate Security Behavior (Important Check) Test Expected Result Your PC → Private instance SSH Blocked Public EC2 → Private EC2 SSH Allowed Private EC2 → Internet Works via NAT → This confirms public exposure = controlled, and private access = secure + functional.\nAs expected.

    "content": "This section will list and introduce the blogs that I have translated.\nBlog 1 - Implementing DevSecOps Ecosystem for Amazon Connect at NatWest. NatWest implemented Amazon Connect with a full DevSecOps ecosystem to power a large-scale, multi-team contact center. Instead of multiple instances, they ran a single shared Connect instance but separated environments across AWS accounts for dev, test, pre-prod, prod, and DR — improving control, security, and stability. Infrastructure was managed through modular Terraform, letting teams deploy independently while enforcing consistent naming, tagging, and security standards. For faster delivery, they built export-import CI/CD pipelines for Amazon Lex bots and QuickSight dashboards instead of writing everything as IaC. Security was multi-layered, combining preventive guardrails (modules, SCPs, static scanning) and detective controls (Config, Inspector, CloudWatch, Security Hub). They also developed utilities to export contact flows as Terraform, manage Contact Lens rules, and generate performance insights. The result: faster development, more reliable releases, stronger security, and a standardized way to operate Amazon Connect across the organization.\nRead full blogs on Google Docs\nBlog 2 - Leverage Q Developer and AWS Chatbot in Slack. This article explains how Amazon Q Developer and AWS Chatbot can be integrated into Slack to provide AI-assisted AWS help directly within a team’s communication workspace. Q Developer acts as a conversational assistant that answers questions, suggests best practices, and helps with onboarding, troubleshooting, architecture design, and certification learning paths. Meanwhile, AWS Chatbot enables users to run AWS CLI commands, open support cases, and receive alerts or notifications from services like S3, Lambda, CloudWatch, and EventBridge — all without leaving Slack. Combined, they support both technical and non-technical users, boosting collaboration and productivity across an organization.\nThe blog highlights real use cases including training new engineers, diagnosing performance issues, optimizing workloads, and applying AWS Well-Architected best practices. It also shows how Q Developer and Chatbot can work together — for example, Chatbot sends alerts to Slack, and Q Developer can interpret those alerts and suggest next steps. An architecture flow is provided showing how Slack connects to Chatbot, which routes requests to Q Developer when needed, with logs stored in CloudWatch. The article ends with setup guidance, covering Chatbot configuration, Slack integration, and enabling Q Developer support — emphasizing that following documentation order is important for a smooth deployment.\nRead full blogs on Google Docs\nBlog 3 - Ten Features to Help Efficiently Manage AWS Applications from Microsoft Teams and Slack Using AWS Chatbot. This article highlights ten AWS Chatbot features that improve DevOps workflows by enabling teams to operate AWS applications directly inside Microsoft Teams and Slack. With ChatOps, engineers can monitor cloud systems, troubleshoot incidents, pull CloudWatch metrics, run commands, retrieve logs, and collaborate in real time without switching tools. Chatbot supports Amazon Q Developer for conversational AWS guidance, as well as IaC provisioning via CDK, SDKs, Cloud Control API, and Terraform. It also allows customizable notifications through SNS/EventBridge, built-in access to CloudWatch dashboards and Logs Insights, and command aliases for fast operational tasks. Action buttons can be added to alerts to trigger automated runbooks, and users can even query resource inventory using natural language. Tags are supported for policy control and organization. These capabilities collectively bring observability and operational response into chat channels, speeding up resolution time and improving team collaboration. All ten features are free to use.\nRead full blogs on Google Docs",
