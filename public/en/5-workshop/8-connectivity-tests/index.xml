This component verifies three things:
Public EC2 is reachable from your local machine Private EC2 is only reachable from the Public EC2 (not directly from the internet) Private EC2 can access the internet through the NAT Gateway 8.1 Connect to the Public EC2 Instance Open the EC2 Console → Instances Copy the Public IPv4 of EC2-Public SSH into the instance This step is dependent on what type of machine you’re using and can vary among different tools. We are using Powershell on a Windows 11 OS PC for this Workshop. You can use other alternatives if you prefer.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en</language><atom:link href="https://wwdinhww.github.io/FCJ-report-HUGO-SE192671/en/5-workshop/8-connectivity-tests/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
