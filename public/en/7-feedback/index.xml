Sharing and Feedback :: AWS Intership Report</title><link>https://wwdinhww.github.io/FCJ-report-HUGO-SE192671/en/7-feedback/index.html</link><description>During my time in AWS Vietnam under the First Cloud Journey (FCJ) program, I experienced a learning environment that challenged me, accelerated my growth, and pushed me beyond the typical student-level knowledge.
FCJ rewards those who are self-driven. I believe it is an exceptional program, but not universally easy. It benefits students who come with curiosity, resilience, and the willingness to learn through action rather than instruction. People like me, who enjoy exploring deeply and independently, will grow extremely fast here.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en</language><atom:link href="https://wwdinhww.github.io/FCJ-report-HUGO-SE192671/en/7-feedback/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
