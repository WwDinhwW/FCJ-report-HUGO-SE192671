Core Architecture of AWS Bedrock Agent The presentation by Kien Nguyen clarified how Bedrock Agent automates multi-step and complex tasks by connecting Foundation Models (FMs) with internal systems and APIs. Execution Mechanism:&#xA;Agents use FM reasoning to understand user intent, break tasks into steps, and execute via Tools / Action Groups. Primary Benefits: Reduces custom code for multi-step workflows. Supports safety guardrails for secure internal system access. 2. Real Use Case — Agentic Workflow Construction Viet Pham’s demo demonstrated how sequential workflows can be transformed into fully automated agent-driven pipelines. Key takeaway: clearly defined capabilities and APIs are required for the agent to act accurately and reliably. 3. Workflow Optimization with CloudThinker CloudThinker focused on solving deep technical challenges (L300) surrounding Agent operation:</description>

      <description>EVENT REPORT: AWS Cloud Mastery Series #3 — Security on AWS Date: Saturday, November 29, 2025&#xA;Time: 8:30 AM – 12:00 PM&#xA;Location: AWS Vietnam Office, Bitexco Financial Tower, District 1, Ho Chi Minh City&#xA;Objective: Deliver deep knowledge across all five pillars of the AWS Well-Architected Security Pillar — including services, core principles, and defensive strategies.&#xA;AGENDA SUMMARY Time Topic Key Focus 08:30 – 08:50 Opening &amp; Security Foundations Shared Responsibility Model, threat landscape in Vietnam. 08:50 – 09:30 Pillar 1 — Identity &amp; Access Management (IAM) Modern IAM design, Roles, Policies, IAM Identity Center, SCP, MFA, Access Analyzer demo. 09:30 – 09:55 Pillar 2 — Detection CloudTrail, GuardDuty, Security Hub, Detection-as-Code model. 10:10 – 10:40 Pillar 3 — Infrastructure Protection VPC segmentation, SG vs NACL, WAF, Network Firewall, workload security. 10:40 – 11:10 Pillar 4 — Data Protection Encryption at-rest/in-transit, KMS, Secrets Manager, data classification. 11:10 – 11:40 Pillar 5 — Incident Response IR lifecycle, playbooks, incident automation using Lambda/Step Functions. 11:40 – 12:00 Closing &amp; Q&amp;A Pitfalls, study roadmap for AWS Security Specialty. SECURITY PILLAR — DEEP TECHNICAL LEARNINGS 1. Security Foundations &amp; Core Principles Emphasis on Least Privilege, Zero Trust, and Defense-in-Depth. Shared Responsibility Model clearly defines roles: AWS secures the Cloud (infrastructure, hardware) Customers secure in the Cloud (data, IAM, configuration) 2. Pillar 1 — Identity &amp; Access Management (IAM) Avoid long-term credentials — rely on Roles + Temporary Access. Multi-account governance using SCPs and Permission Boundaries. Mini-demo using Access Analyzer for policy validation &amp; risk detection. 3. Pillar 2 — Detection CloudTrail for full API logging (organization-wide). GuardDuty ML-driven threat detection. Security Hub for consolidated security findings. Detection-as-Code for automated rule deployment &amp; alerting. 4. Pillar 3 — Infrastructure Protection VPC segmentation for tier separation (Web / App / DB). Difference between Security Groups (stateful) vs Network ACLs (stateless). Edge protection using WAF + AWS Shield for DDoS and L7 attack defense. 5. Pillar 4 — Data Protection Encryption required end-to-end: at-rest &amp; in-transit. AWS KMS for key management, rotation, and policy control. Secrets Manager for secure storage + automatic rotation of sensitive credentials. 6. Pillar 5 — Incident Response IR lifecycle: Prepare → Detect → Respond → Recover. Automated remediation with Lambda / Step Functions playbooks. Key response actions: snapshot, isolate, evidence capture. EVALUATION &amp; NEXT STEPS Evaluation This event outlined a complete and structured blueprint for AWS security — not only service-by-service, but as a full architectural strategy following the Well-Architected Framework. Extremely valuable for developers and Ops teams deploying production workloads under Zero-Trust standards.</description>
