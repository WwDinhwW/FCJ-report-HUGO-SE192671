Time: 8:30 AM – 12:00 AM
Location: AWS Vietnam Office, Bitexco Financial Tower, District 1, Ho Chi Minh City
Objective: Deliver deep knowledge across all five pillars of the AWS Well-Architected Security Pillar — including services, core principles, and defensive strategies.
AGENDA SUMMARY Time Topic Key Focus 08:30 – 08:50 Opening &amp; Security Foundations Shared Responsibility Model, threat landscape in Vietnam. 08:50 – 09:30 Pillar 1 — Identity &amp; Access Management (IAM) Modern IAM design, Roles, Policies, IAM Identity Center, SCP, MFA, Access Analyzer demo. 09:30 – 09:55 Pillar 2 — Detection CloudTrail, GuardDuty, Security Hub, Detection-as-Code model. 10:10 – 10:40 Pillar 3 — Infrastructure Protection VPC segmentation, SG vs NACL, WAF, Network Firewall, workload security. 10:40 – 11:10 Pillar 4 — Data Protection Encryption at-rest/in-transit, KMS, Secrets Manager, data classification. 11:10 – 11:40 Pillar 5 — Incident Response IR lifecycle, playbooks, incident automation using Lambda/Step Functions. 11:40 – 12:00 Closing &amp; Q&amp;A Pitfalls, study roadmap for AWS Security Specialty. SECURITY PILLAR — DEEP TECHNICAL LEARNINGS 1. Security Foundations &amp; Core Principles Emphasis on Least Privilege, Zero Trust, and Defense-in-Depth. Shared Responsibility Model clearly defines roles: AWS secures the Cloud (infrastructure, hardware) Customers secure in the Cloud (data, IAM, configuration) 2. Pillar 1 — Identity &amp; Access Management (IAM) Avoid long-term credentials — rely on Roles + Temporary Access. Multi-account governance using SCPs and Permission Boundaries. Mini-demo using Access Analyzer for policy validation &amp; risk detection. 3. Pillar 2 — Detection CloudTrail for full API logging (organization-wide). GuardDuty ML-driven threat detection. Security Hub for consolidated security findings. Detection-as-Code for automated rule deployment &amp; alerting. 4. Pillar 3 — Infrastructure Protection VPC segmentation for tier separation (Web / App / DB). Difference between Security Groups (stateful) vs Network ACLs (stateless). Edge protection using WAF + AWS Shield for DDoS and L7 attack defense. 5. Pillar 4 — Data Protection Encryption required end-to-end: at-rest &amp; in-transit. AWS KMS for key management, rotation, and policy control. Secrets Manager for secure storage + automatic rotation of sensitive credentials. 6. Pillar 5 — Incident Response IR lifecycle: Prepare → Detect → Respond → Recover. Automated remediation with Lambda / Step Functions playbooks. Key response actions: snapshot, isolate, evidence capture. EVALUATION &amp; NEXT STEPS Evaluation This event outlined a complete and structured blueprint for AWS security — not only service-by-service, but as a full architectural strategy following the Well-Architected Framework. Extremely valuable for developers and Ops teams deploying production workloads under Zero-Trust standards.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en</language><atom:link href="https://wwdinhww.github.io/FCJ-report-HUGO-SE192671/en/4-events/event_5/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
