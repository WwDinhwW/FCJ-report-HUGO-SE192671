      <description>This section will list and introduce the blogs that I have translated.&#xA;Blog 1 - Implementing DevSecOps Ecosystem for Amazon Connect at NatWest. NatWest implemented Amazon Connect with a full DevSecOps ecosystem to power a large-scale, multi-team contact center. Instead of multiple instances, they ran a single shared Connect instance but separated environments across AWS accounts for dev, test, pre-prod, prod, and DR — improving control, security, and stability. Infrastructure was managed through modular Terraform, letting teams deploy independently while enforcing consistent naming, tagging, and security standards. For faster delivery, they built export-import CI/CD pipelines for Amazon Lex bots and QuickSight dashboards instead of writing everything as IaC. Security was multi-layered, combining preventive guardrails (modules, SCPs, static scanning) and detective controls (Config, Inspector, CloudWatch, Security Hub). They also developed utilities to export contact flows as Terraform, manage Contact Lens rules, and generate performance insights. The result: faster development, more reliable releases, stronger security, and a standardized way to operate Amazon Connect across the organization.</description>
