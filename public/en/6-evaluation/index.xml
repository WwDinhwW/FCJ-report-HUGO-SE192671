Self-Evaluation :: AWS Intership Report</title><link>https://wwdinhww.github.io/FCJ-report-HUGO-SE192671/en/6-evaluation/index.html</link><description>During my internship at AWS Vietnam (September – December 2025), I had the opportunity to explore cloud computing in depth while building and documenting a practical learning project.
