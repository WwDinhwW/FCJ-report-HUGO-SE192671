During my time in AWS Vietnam under the **First Cloud Journey (FCJ)** program, I experienced a learning environment that
challenged me, accelerated my growth, and pushed me beyond the typical student-level knowledge.

FCJ rewards those who are self-driven. I believe it is an exceptional program, but not universally easy. It benefits
students who come with curiosity, resilience, and the willingness to learn through action rather than instruction.
People like me, who enjoy exploring deeply and independently, will grow extremely fast here.

## Overall Evaluation

### What FCJ Did Extremely Well

| Strength                                      | Why it matters                                                                         |
|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Autonomy to learn & build independently**   | I wasn’t handed answers, I learned by thinking, trying, and solving.                   |
| **Full real AWS access (not sandbox-level)**  | Allowed true production-oriented experimentation, not just theory.                     |
| **Cloud Optimization & Cost Awareness**       | Rarely taught in school, yet critical in real cloud engineering.                       |
| **Hands-off mentoring approach**              | Guided by questions and direction, not micromanagement.                                |
| **Strong documentation & learning resources** | Helped me research deeply and build at my own pace.                                    |
| **Growth in Backend + DevOps + Security**     | Redis caching, IAM, KMS, CloudWatch, CI/CD, and more, all hands-on, not just lectures. |
| **High learning curve, in a good way**        | The pace never felt boring. You learn as fast as you push yourself.                    |

The program shaped my mindset as much as my technical skills, I now think in terms of *scalability, cost, security,
monitoring, failure-tolerance*, not just "make it run".

## Where FCJ Can Improve

### FCJ teaches the tools, but could add more **production practice**

Technical knowledge was excellent, AWS services, backend development, optimization principles, but I believe the
program could be even better with more exposure to **real production workflows**, such as:

| Improvement Suggestion               | Benefit to Future Interns                                      |
|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| More production-style simulations    | Helps interns learn how systems behave under real load.        |
| Practical troubleshooting challenges | Builds confidence in debugging failures & analyzing incidents. |
| More real-world scenario workshops   | Connects AWS theory with actual industry operations.           |

Not a criticism, more like *potential fuel to make an already strong program even stronger*.

## Who I Recommend FCJ To

I would absolutely recommend FCJ, **but only to the right type of person.**

**Perfect for:**

- Students who want to *build*, not just watch
- People who enjoy self-learning & documentation digging
- Those who like challenge over comfort
- Anyone who wants real AWS, not just classroom AWS

**Not ideal for:**

- Someone who waits for instructions
- Someone afraid to try, break, learn, retry
- Someone looking for 9-5 low effort routine

FCJ is not *easy*. But it is *worth it*, massively.

### Final Thoughts

FCJ has been one of the most valuable learning experiences I’ve ever had.  
I walk away not only with technical skills, but with mindset, discipline, and confidence that I can build, scale,
secure, and optimize cloud systems on my own.

**My conclusion is simple:  
FCJ doesn’t just teach cloud, it shapes cloud engineers.**
