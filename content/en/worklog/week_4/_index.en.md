# Objectives:
* Understand the **Shared Responsibility Model** and AWS identity management services.
* Learn the core security services: IAM, Cognito, KMS, Security Hub, and AWS Organization.
* Apply knowledge in practice by integrating **CloudWatch** and **Cost Explorer** into the reporting system.
* Get familiar with automation tools (**GitHub Actions**) and Python SDK (**boto3**) for interacting with AWS services.
