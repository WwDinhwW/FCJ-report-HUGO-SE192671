* Learn optimization techniques for low-latency delivery using CloudFront.
* Gain practical knowledge of web application security: threat mitigation, bot protection, and OWASP best practices.
* Integrate performance and security insights into the Report Site and backend project.

# Tasks Completed:
| Day | Tasks                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Start Date | Completion Date | Reference Sources             |
|-----|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|-----------------|-------------------------------|
| Mon | - Studied AWS **Content Delivery Networks (CDNs)** and global edge infrastructure. <br> - Learned how CloudFront reduces latency using caching, edge locations, and request routing.                                             | 17/11/2025 | 17/11/2025      | AWS Docs, Internet            |
| Tue | - Researched advanced CloudFront optimization techniques: cache policies, TTL tuning, origin failover, and edge security controls. <br> - Documented best practices into the Report Site’s “Cloud Optimization” section.         | 18/11/2025 | 18/11/2025      | AWS Docs, internal references |
| Wed | - Studied **AWS WAF** fundamentals: request filtering, blocking malicious traffic, mitigating threats like SQLi/XSS. <br> - Analyzed the **OWASP Top 10** and how WAF rulesets mitigate common vulnerabilities.                  | 19/11/2025 | 19/11/2025      | AWS Docs, Security Blogs      |
| Thu | - Learned about **bot mitigation**, anomaly detection patterns, and rate-limiting strategies to protect web workloads at scale. <br> - Explored security integration between CloudFront, WAF, and Shield for layered protection. | 20/11/2025 | 20/11/2025      | AWS Docs, Internet            |
| Fri | - Practiced applying performance and security concepts to the backend project. <br> - Updated internal documentation: CloudFront optimization, WAF rule design, and secure deployment patterns for web applications.             | 21/11/2025 | 21/11/2025      | Internal docs, Internet       |

# Results:
