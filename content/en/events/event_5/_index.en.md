## KEY KNOWLEDGE GAINED

### 1. CloudFront — Content Delivery & Edge Optimization

- Understanding CDN fundamentals & differences between Edge Location, Regional Edge Cache, and Origin.
- Advanced routing + caching strategy to reduce latency and boost global distribution speed.
- Implementing edge-level security layers (Origin Shield, cache policies, geo restrictions).

→ CloudFront is not only a CDN — it is also a performance + security perimeter for backend systems.

---

### 2. AWS WAF — Layered Web Protection

- Configuring WAF against bots, SQL injection, XSS & **OWASP Top 10** threats.
- Writing rules, conditions, match patterns, rate limiting, IP allow/deny lists.
- Reduced malicious traffic load, protecting backend compute & business logic.

→ Standout point: rules can be tailored precisely for each application’s behavior.

---

### 3. Hands-On Labs — Knowledge into Execution

**Workshop 1: Performance Optimization**
- Configured CloudFront with Lambda@Edge/Function URL.
- Compared latency before vs after configuration.
- Improved cache-hit ratio and UI response speed.

**Workshop 2: Security Hardening**
- Designed WAF protection policies.
- Simulated bot traffic & executed block/detect mechanisms.
- Understood how WAF evaluates request intent before allowing or rejecting traffic.

→ Practical execution was the most valuable part — theory became tangible.

## EVALUATION & FUTURE APPLICATION

| Value Gained                    | Real-World Application                              |
|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Advanced CloudFront knowledge   | Deploy CDN for large-scale global traffic handling. |
| Deep AWS WAF understanding      | Harden enterprise apps & reduce attack surface.     |
| Practical deployment experience | Faster production rollout — fewer config mistakes.  |
| Networking with AWS specialists | More learning & collaboration opportunities.        |

### Personal Next Steps

1. Build an internal CloudFront + WAF demo environment.
2. Practice more WAF rules — especially bot control & OWASP attack defense use cases.
3. Study Lambda@Edge for edge-level logic processing to reduce backend workload.
