During my internship at **AWS Vietnam** (September – December 2025), I had the opportunity to explore cloud computing in
depth while building and documenting a practical learning project. I approached each task sincerely, researching
carefully, understanding concepts before applying them, and prioritizing correctness over rushing.

Across the 12 weeks, I steadily expanded my abilities in **AWS services, backend development, cloud optimization,
DevOps, and security engineering**. The internship helped me form a structured technical mindset and improved my
confidence in working with real cloud infrastructure.

## Internship Summary

Throughout the internship, I developed and refined:

### **Backend Development (FastAPI / Python / AWS SDK)**

- Implemented API routes for CloudWatch, Cost Explorer, S3 and SecurityHub
- Integrated caching + async concurrency using Redis
- Improved request handling performance through optimization and batching

### **Report Site & Documentation**

- Built structured technical documentation using Hugo
- Added multilingual support and CI/CD deployment workflow
- Wrote knowledge summaries on cloud services, optimization, and security

### **Cloud Skills Expanded**

- EC2, VPC, S3, IAM, RDS, DynamoDB, CloudWatch
- Storage tiering, lifecycle, caching optimization
- Cloud Monitoring, Logging, Security Intelligence
- IAM least privilege, KMS encryption, WAF + OWASP mitigation
- CDN performance with CloudFront, rate control, edge routing
- AI/ML workflow fundamentals: SageMaker, Bedrock, RAG principles

My learning progressed continuously and consistently throughout the internship.

## Final Reflection

This internship helped me mature as an engineer.  
I became more methodical, more aware of cloud-scale systems, and more confident in designing solutions thoughtfully.  
I still have much to learn, but now I know *how to learn properly*. I am very grateful for the opportunity, and I will
continue building upon everything I gained here.
