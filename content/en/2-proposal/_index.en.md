## 2. Problem Statement

### Current Challenges:

Businesses managing AWS infrastructure for multiple clients face:

- **No centralized monitoring:** Must log into each client's AWS console separately
- **Scattered security alerts:** Critical GuardDuty findings go unnoticed
- **Cost visibility gaps:** Difficult to track and optimize costs across clients
- **Insecure credential management:** AWS access keys stored in databases or config files
- **No automated deployment:** Manual deployment leads to errors and downtime
- **Lack of security scanning:** Vulnerabilities deployed to production
- **No audit logging:** Cannot track security events and API calls
- **Manual monitoring:** 30+ minutes daily per client
- **Downtime during deployments:** No zero-downtime deployment strategy
- **Dynamic IPs:** IP changes on restart causing DNS/whitelist issues

## 3. Solution Architecture

### Architecture Overview

![final_architecture.drawio.png](/images/2-Proposal/final_architecture.drawio.png)

### Key Components:

- **Internet Gateway:** VPC entry point for incoming traffic
- **Application Load Balancer (ALB):**
    - Distributes traffic across availability zones
    - SSL/TLS termination with ACM certificates
    - Health checks with automatic failover
    - Path-based routing capability
    - DDoS protection (AWS Shield Standard)
- **Elastic IP:**
    - Static public IPv4 address for EC2 instance
    - FREE when attached to running instance
    - Persistent across instance restarts
    - Enables stable SSH access and IP whitelisting
- **EC2 Instance (t3.micro):** Application server processing
- **Zero-Downtime Deployment:** Blue-green strategy using target groups
- **DynamoDB:** Multi-tenant data storage
- **Redis:** In-memory caching layer
- **AWS Secrets Manager:** Secure credential storage
- **CloudWatch & CloudTrail:** Monitoring and audit logging

### Data Flow

#### 1. DEVELOPER WORKFLOW (DevSecOps with Zero-Downtime Deployment)

```markdown
Developer → Git push → GitHub → CodePipeline triggered
→ CodeBuild runs:
  • Install dependencies
  • Run tests (pytest)
  • Security scan (Bandit, Safety)
  • Build frontend
  • SSH to EC2 (via Elastic IP) → Deploy new version
  • ALB health check validates deployment
  • Traffic cutover (zero downtime)
→ CloudWatch logs everything
```

#### 2. INCOMING TRAFFIC (Production Flow)

```markdown
Client Browser → HTTPS (Cloudflare CDN/SSL)
→ Internet Gateway → ALB (ACM certificate, SSL termination)
→ Target Group (health check: /health endpoint)
→ EC2 Instance (Elastic IP attached, FastAPI application)
→ Response back through ALB → Client
```

#### 3. CLIENT SIGNUP

```markdown
Customer → Enter AWS Access key → Click login → Account auto create
→ API (through ALB) → Validate AWS keys
→ Store in Secrets Manager (KMS encrypted)
→ Store metadata in DynamoDB
```

#### 4. EMAIL VERIFICATION

```markdown
Customer → Enter email → Check email → Send verify email 
→ Click link → ALB → API → Verify token
→ Mark email verified → CloudTrail logs event
```

#### 5. WORKER MANAGER (Multi-Tenant)

```markdown
Every 15 min → Fetch active clients from DynamoDB
→ For each client:
  • Get credentials from Secrets Manager
  • Schedule async task for data collection
  • Collect AWS data
  • Cache in Redis (5 min TTL)
  • Store in DynamoDB
```

#### 6. DATA COLLECTION (Per Client)

```markdown
Async Task → Secrets Manager (get credentials)
→ Client AWS API → Collect metrics
→ Cache in Redis → Store in DynamoDB (partitioned by aws_account_id)
→ If critical finding → Send email alert (SES)
→ CloudWatch logs all operations
```

#### 7. DASHBOARD DISPLAY

```markdown
Customer login → Request through ALB → FastAPI checks Redis cache
→ Cache HIT: Return cached data (< 200ms)
→ Cache MISS: Query DynamoDB (filtered by aws_account_id)
→ Store in Redis → Return data through ALB
```

#### 8. HEALTH CHECKS & FAILOVER

```markdown
ALB → Every 30s → GET /health endpoint
→ If unhealthy (2 consecutive failures):
  • Mark target unhealthy
  • Stop routing traffic
  • CloudWatch alarm triggered
  • Systemd attempts auto-restart
→ When healthy: Resume traffic routing
```

#### 9. SSH ACCESS & MANAGEMENT

```markdown
DevOps Engineer → SSH to Elastic IP
→ Direct EC2 access for:
  • Deployment verification
  • Log inspection
  • Emergency troubleshooting
  • System maintenance
→ Stable IP (no DNS updates needed)
```

#### 10. SECURITY & AUDIT

```markdown
All API calls → CloudTrail logging
Credentials access → CloudWatch alarm
Failed auth attempts → Email alert
KMS key usage → Audit trail
ALB access logs → S3 (optional, for compliance)
```

| **TOTAL Year 2+**         | **$47-57/month** | Production-grade with ALB         |

### Scaling Costs

#### Year 1 (Free Tier EC2):

- **10 clients:** Platform $39 + (10 × $0.59) = $44.90/month
- **20 clients:** Platform $39 + (20 × $0.59) = $50.80/month
- **50 clients:** Platform $39 + (50 × $0.59) = $68.50/month

#### Year 2+ (Paid EC2):

- **10 clients:** Platform $47 + (10 × $0.59) = $52.90/month
- **20 clients:** Platform $47 + (20 × $0.59) = $58.80/month
- **50 clients:** Platform $47 + (50 × $0.59) = $76.50/month

**Scale Note:** With EC2 t3.micro, the platform can efficiently support 10-20 clients. To scale to 50+ clients, upgrade
to larger instances (t3.small/medium) is recommended. ALB architecture makes horizontal scaling straightforward by
adding instances to the target group.

### Future Optimizations:

- **Reserved Instances:** 30-40% savings on EC2 (after 12 months)
- **Savings Plans:** Flexible commitment-based discounts
- **Spot Instances:** For non-critical background tasks (70-90% savings)
- **S3 Intelligent-Tiering:** Automatic cost optimization for backups
- **CloudWatch Logs optimization:** Adjust retention (7-90 days)

### Total Infrastructure Investment:

- **Year 1:** $39-49/month (with free tier EC2 + Elastic IP)
- **Year 2+:** $47-57/month (full pricing, Elastic IP still FREE)
- **Per Client:** $0.59/month (scalable and predictable)

This represents exceptional value for a production-grade, highly available, secure multi-tenant SaaS platform with
static IP infrastructure.
