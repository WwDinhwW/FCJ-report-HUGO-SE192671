# EVENT REPORT: **AWS Cloud Mastery Series #1 — AI/ML/GenAI on AWS**

**Date:** Saturday, November 15, 2025  

**Time:** 8:00 AM – 11:30 AM  

**Location:** AWS Vietnam Office, Bitexco Financial Tower, District 1, Ho Chi Minh City  

**Objective:** Provide foundational to advanced understanding of AI/ML services and Generative AI (GenAI) on AWS.

---

## 1. Opening & Context (8:00 – 8:30 AM)

- Registration and networking to kick off the event.
- Session introduced learning objectives and workshop structure.
- Overview of AI/ML landscape in Vietnam — trends, opportunities, and challenges.

---

## 2. AWS AI/ML Platform Overview (8:30 – 10:00 AM)

The morning session focused on **Amazon SageMaker**, AWS’s fully managed end-to-end machine learning platform.

### Key Topics

- **ML Lifecycle:**  
  Data preparation, labeling, training, fine-tuning, deployment, and inference workflows.

- **Built-in MLOps:**  
  Native MLOps capabilities in SageMaker enable automated pipeline management for production-grade ML.

- **Live Demo — SageMaker Studio:**  
  Demonstration of the IDE environment used for notebook development, training jobs, and model experimentation.

---

### 10:00 – 10:15 AM | Coffee Break

---

## 3. Generative AI with Amazon Bedrock (10:20 – 11:30 AM)

The second half of the session shifted to GenAI architecture using **Amazon Bedrock** and Foundation Models (FMs).

### Core Learning Points

- **Foundation Models:**  
  Comparison of leading models — **Claude, Llama, Titan** — and use-case model selection strategies.

- **Prompt Engineering:**  
  Practical techniques including *Chain-of-Thought reasoning* and *Few-shot prompting* to improve model output quality.

- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):**  
  Architecture, Knowledge Base integration, and how RAG boosts model accuracy using internal data.

- **Bedrock Agents & Guardrails:**  
  Building multi-step agent workflows and enforcing safe AI behavior using Guardrails.

- **Live Demo:**  
  Hands-on demonstration of building a simple GenAI chatbot using Bedrock components.

---

### 11:30 AM — Closing & Lunch

Participants concluded the session and proceeded to lunch (individual arrangement).

---

## GENERAL EVALUATION & NEXT STEPS

### Evaluation

The session offered strong coverage of both pillars of AI on AWS:

- **SageMaker** for full-cycle ML development and custom model training.
- **Bedrock** for rapid GenAI deployment using Foundation Models.

Live demos provided real clarity on how organizations can adopt these services effectively.

### Key Takeaways

- Understanding the end-to-end ML lifecycle in SageMaker.
- Foundation Models, RAG, and Agents as core components of modern GenAI workloads.

### Recommended Next Steps

1. **Hands-on with Bedrock:**  
   Begin experimenting with **prompt engineering** using FMs like Claude or Titan to build prototypes.

2. **Deep-dive into SageMaker:**  
   Explore **MLOps automation** for deployment pipelines, model monitoring, and CI/CD for machine learning.
